Hello visitor, this is Mohammad Ramadan, PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. In particular, Iâ€™m a **control theorist** with experience in **stochastic optimal control, optimal filtering,** and **system identification**.

I'm currently in **Naperville (Chicago West Suburbs), IL**, working with the Mathematics and Computer Science Division, **Argonne National Laboratory**. These are my [Github](https://github.com/msramada), my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h7pE-VcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msramada1/). Let's connect!

A little about me (outside research):
I'm into music, theory and production, and all sorts of movements: working out, yoga, calisthenics, wrestling and Brazillian jiu jitsu.
